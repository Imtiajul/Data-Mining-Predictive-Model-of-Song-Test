# CSE477 Project: Data Mining Predictive Model of Song Test
We worked on spotify dataset with 2017 smaples. We mainly used two models Decision Tree and Naive Bayes, and make a comparative analysis. 
Additionaly, we worked on Apriori models with different dataset to fulfil our project instruction. 
We fit our Apriori models with super shop dataset where dataset contains 9835 customer records. 

## Dependency: 
* Python 
* Panda
* scikit learn
* Jupyter Notebook


We have used 3 models for our work namly Decision Tree,  Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine.
#### Decision Tree
A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements.

#### Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features. Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.

#### Support Vector Machine 
A support vector machine (SVM) is machine learning algorithm that analyzes data for classification and regression analysis. SVM is a supervised learning method that looks at data and sorts it into one of two categories. An SVM outputs a map of the sorted data with the margins between the two as far apart as possible. 

#### Apriori
Apriori Algorithm is a Machine Learning algorithm which is used to gain insight into the structured relationships between different items involved. The most prominent practical application of the algorithm is to recommend products based on the products already present in the user’s cart. Walmart especially has made great use of the algorithm in suggesting products to it’s users.
