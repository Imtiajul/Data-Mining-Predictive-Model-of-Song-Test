We are using 3 methods - Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes
#### Decision Tree
A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements.
#### Support Vector Machine 
A support vector machine (SVM) is machine learning algorithm that analyzes data for classification and regression analysis. SVM is a supervised learning method that looks at data and sorts it into one of two categories. An SVM outputs a map of the sorted data with the margins between the two as far apart as possible. 
#### Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features. Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.
